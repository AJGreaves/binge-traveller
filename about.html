                    From as long as I can remember, I have always had an interest in geography. From sketching maps of
                    Ireland to flicking through the pages of an atlas. By Primary School, I knew the capitals of all the
                    countries in the world as well as rivers, mountains, lakes and various cities. I knew the flags of
                    each country and dreamed of what it would be like to visit such far flung destinations and how it
                    might be different to living in rural Ireland.

                    My Dad bought me a "bigger and better" atlas at a school book fair, and I literally never took my
                    head out of this book! At the same time, I discovered a passion for aviation and plane spotting and
                    so my parents bought me a pair of binoculars for Christmas when I was about 10 years old, so that I
                    could plane spot quite easily from my garden. I longed to be on those planes which were zooming at
                    40,000 feet over my head and wondered where in the world they might be going to. My bedroom wall was
                    covered in pictures of maps and photos of aeroplanes from ceiling to floor. I had written to various
                    embassies in Ireland for further information about their mission and home country, as well as to
                    airline offices for photos and pictures of their aircraft. There was also a globe of the world
                    sitting on my bedside locker sitting on top of atlases and maps, inspiration from the moment I
                    opened my eyes!

                    With my parents and grandparents, I visited Dublin Airport, Shannon Airport and Knock Airport and I
                    immediately knew “this was my place, this is where I belonged”. I was completely amazed not just by
                    the buzz of the airport, but by the beauty of the aircraft up close and seeing the huge departure
                    board flicking with names of cities I had read about and looked up in my atlas:
                    <span class="blue-text">Athens, Copenhagen, New York, Helsinki. Toronto.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Oh, what I would give to head off to any of these places! I had no sense of fear, I felt so
                    independent and just wished to go through those departure gates and jump on a plane. Any plane!

                    It wasn’t until I was 15 years old, that I got to take my first trip abroad and get to
                    travel on a plane for the first time. I was in 4th year in secondary school, and our school had
                    organised a trip to Barcelona. I begged my parents to allow me to go and they agreed to let me go on
                    this tour! I don’t think I was ever as excited in my life. We flew on an old Ryanair Boeing 737-200
                    from Dublin to London’s Stansted airport and from there a coach to Dover. We crossed the English
                    channel to Calais by ferry and drove through the entire length of France via Troyes and Lyon down to
                    Barcelona. We stopped in Paris on the return journey and I was in awe of the Eiffel Tower and Arc de
                    Triomphe. I took 3 rolls of film for my camera and snapped pictures of everything that I saw! I came
                    back a changed person as I had finally tasted what it was like to visit a new place. This trip lives
                    long in my memory and I even still have my old Ryanair boarding card from May 1996.

                    At this point, I had penpals in numerous different countries around the world. Egypt, Australia,
                    Finland, Italy, Cyprus, Israel, Russia, Peru…. I was exchanging photos, cassette tapes of local
                    music, stamps, currency and learning more about life in other countries. It was also a fantastic way
                    to brush up on my written French skills and hence I had about 6 French penpals on the go at one
                    time! I may have stolen money from my mothers purse in order to buy stamps at the Post Office and I
                    most definitely was caught by teachers many times in class at school writing letters to said
                    penpals. All of which got me into trouble as you might imagine!

                    I then went into Leaving Cert with a renewed interest in Geography and French and I decided to
                    pursue my degree in Dublin City University (DCU) studying a Bachelors in Applied Computational
                    Linguistics. I deliberately selected this course as it allowed me to spend the third year of my
                    program at a French university as part of the Erasmus exchange program. I eventually went to
                    “Université de Provence I” in Aix-en-Provence in the south of France close to Marseille. Being based
                    here, I was able to visit amazing towns and cities throughout the south of France and my love and
                    thirst for travel and experiencing new things just grew and grew. I swam in the Mediterranean Sea at
                    Plages du Prado in Marseille. I visited the incredible Palais des Papes in Avignon. I admired the
                    stunning lavender fields near Salon de Provence. I attended the Monaco Grand Prix in Monte Carlo and
                    strolled on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice. I literally was in heaven here and never wanted to
                    leave.

                    Once I had reluctantly returned to Dublin and completed my degree, I vowed that I would travel the
                    world and lead my life in a way that I get to experience as much culture and meet as many new people
                    as possible. Over the years, I have discovered that I am a person who is not driven by material
                    possessions, I much rather spend my money on experiences and see the world with my own eyes. When I
                    call my parents or friends now, they typically ask “Where are you?” rather than “How are you?” LOL.

                    As a tradition, I always start my journey with a pint of beer at Dublin Airport, whether it is 5am
                    or 10pm. I have a few more on the plane (naturally!) just to pass the time, and I am always eager to
                    try out local food and beer/wine etc at my destination. As a result, the idea of “Binge Traveller”
                    was born. The aim is to provide inspiration to fellow solo travellers as well as LGBT travellers who
                    would like to gain an insight into cities or places which may be welcoming and inclusive. I am by no
                    means a professional photographer or script writer, but I do hope that by documenting my personal
                    experiences and capturing some amateur photos along the way, I can allow you to step outside your
                    comfort zone and perhaps visit somewhere that you thought might be out of reach! All my pics are
                    taken by iPhone 11 or GoPro Hero 9.

                    Finally, I absolutely must say that I will be forever grateful to my parents as they were the ones
                    who instilled the love of travel in me from the very start. From buying me an atlas, binoculars and
                    allowing me to go on the school tour - these were the foundation stones that allowed me to discover
                    the joy of travel and which today is my sole passion in life.

                    Bug hugs,
