                    <!-- Paragraphs of content, repeat for as many as you need -->
                    <p>When you think of Croatia, you automatically think Dubrovnik or Split both located on the
                        stunning Adriatic Sea. However, I wanted to avoid the crowds of tourists and decided to try out
                        the Croatian capital : Zagreb. And I can assure you that I was not disappointed!</p>

                    <p>Croatia is in the EU and uses its own currency which is called the Hryvnia. You can pick this up
                        in Dublin Airport before your flight at the currency exchange counter.</p>

                    <!-- If you want additional sub headings in your post, use the level 3 version here -->
                    <!-- <div class="h3 blue-text display-6 mt-4 mb-2">Blog level 3 sub heading</div> -->
                    <p>Direct flights between Dublin and Zagreb are available with Croatia Airlines, 3 times weekly on
                        Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. I went for a 3 night break and decided to book an apartment
                        using booking.com. I stayed at Mango Apartman, Builceva 7, Zagreb. The apartment/studio was
                        incredibly clean and the owner even organised a free taxi to collect me at the airport. I paid
                        €180 for 3 nights and it was absolutely perfect. The host was super friendly and I would have
                        absolutely no hesitation to stay there again. I would highly recommend it, just a 5 minute walk
                        into the main city square.</p>
                    <p>As Zagreb is a pretty small capital by international standards, you can walk absolutely
                        everywhere. No need to use any of the trams or any public transport. </p>
                    <p>The Main Square (Trg Bana Josip) is the focal point of the city and you should orient yourself
                        based on its location. Behind this square and only a 5 minute stroll away, you will find the
                        beautiful Zagreb Cathedral with its tall twin spires and a very lively Market (Dolac Market)
                        with stalls and stands selling everything from fruit and veg, locally produced honey, ornaments
                        and replica (fake) Croatia soccer jerseys!</p>
                    <p>Next on your list about a 10 minute walk from here should be the Museum of Broken Relationships.
                        A pretty interesting if not bizarre museum which contains various mementos of doomed and failed
                        romances. Haven’t seen anything quite like this before, so well worth heading inside even if it
                        is some respite out of the sun!</p>
                    <p>Further ahead, you can walk towards the stunning St Marks Church with its beautiful coloured
                        tiled roof which display the emblems of Croatia and Zagreb. Have a look inside, but it is
                        definitely the exterior of this church which is most impressive. In this square, you will also
                        find the “Sabor” which is the Parliament Building as well as the Presidential Palace.
                        This square is definitely an excellent spot for some selfies!
                    </p>
                    <p>For the best views in Zagreb, you can take a walk up the Lotrscak Tower where you can enjoy some
                        fine 360-degree views over the entire city. Every day at noon, a canon is fired from the top of
                        this tower as crowds gather below. The noise is deafening and can certainly catch you off guard,
                        so be aware!</p>
                    <p>The main strip where you will find the majority of Pubs/Restaurants is called “Ul Ivana
                        Tkalcica”. Definitely a people watching haven, you can grab a coffee during the day or stop by
                        for a cocktail and go bar crawling and enjoy the atmosphere at night. My main go-to was the
                        Croatian Beers which are extremely cheap: “Karlovacko” and “Ozujsko” the main beer brands that I
                        would recommend.</p>
                    <p>Zagreb is a clean, safe and very lively city with a buzzing atmosphere. I am definitely going to
                        go back and the Croats are always so friendly and welcoming. It is a cheap city, plenty of
                        options for dining depending on your budget and everywhere is within walking distance. Give
                        Zagreb a try, I think you will enjoy it! :)</p>
